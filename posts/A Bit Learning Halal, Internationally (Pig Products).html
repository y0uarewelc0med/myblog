        <p>Are you thinking i've heard this from muslim community? For this TED Talk, that's not the case.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px;">Me Seeing Pig (In That TED Talk)</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  I was randomly watch "How Pig Parts Make The World Turn" by Christine. An old
  video, but for me, it still worth to watch. And first time knowing pig parts
  name.. or vocabularies, whatever. And the other terms that maybe only food or
  medicine industry familiar with, combining with numbers and get people would
  say "meh, whatever, looks delicious, tho"; then you just throw it to your
  cart, when buying.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  I was quietly mesmerized how people using pig as products so.. efficiently~
  And it opens my eyes when it starts talking about bread products. 'So, the
  bread itself isn't simply plant-based?' yeah that's what comes in my mind. And
  maybe another gasp for the other processed food products.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  And then like, wow... Pig parts can help the house construction, like concrete
  and sandpaper? And paint brush.. oh ok there's news about this brushes in
  Indonesia too. And cigarette.. bullets?! Okay, that's such creative
  innovation!!! There will be less food loss and waste, i hope...
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px;">Thinking About Pig Market...</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  I'm thinking how massive the pig products.. or product that contain pig..
  (whatever it is) is being distributed, till being exported.
</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
  <li>
    It is said the choices of pig parts or being more affordable than other
    animals, like cows and sheep.
  </li>
  <li>
    Or... It can be due to the demand and the potential market Industries
    dominates products that contain pig itself. And the gov supports it as well
  </li>
  <li>Or both of them are bring more customers consume them.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">Yeah, so, many sectors supports each other, i guess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  With the products that usually western or non muslim people eats.. daily? With
  the food culture that influence. And how there's pig farm/ industry that
  sustain this market.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  Pig are massively being consumed for almost every parts of it. Like every part
  of coconut palm plant are compatible to use, and it inspired Indonesia Scout's
  logo! --yeah my conclusion for that old TED Talk video.. a bit out of topic,
  but whatever.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px;">For Muslim, Look What You Consumed!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  Here, i'll suggest for any muslim to consider what you consume, whatever where
  you living. Even if when you're living in muslim majority country, there's
  still exported products!
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  You can seeing any imported products around you, then questioning yourself.
  After reviewing products carefully, are you their target market or it is for
  non-muslim? Is it the export-import regulation is good enough in your country?
  Is it halal-certified when it comes to your closest market?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  Brace yourself to know every single things you consume! Do more research, or
  take consultation to scholars, experts, or someone who's interested in this
  one.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
  Good intention and Allah always knows, and He's The Best Planner for your
  <i>deen</i>~
