    <h1 class="titlebox" style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left;">Peek A Pig Privilege in Indonesian Muslim</h1>
        <div class="blackbox">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">There's A Lot of 'Halal' Here.</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"
      >Living in majority religion that i
      believed what such a privilege. Also living in the island that most of
      them are muslim too, Java Island! Specially when there's bunch of halal
      certified products. Maybe some of you will surprised how diverse halal
      certification here (not only food!). Like, what you have to worry
      about?</p
    >
    <p style="text-align: justify;"
      >Learning it's good thing to know
      market for halal food in other countries that's not familiar with halal
      and tayyiban food. (As we talk before
      <a
        href="https://y0uarewelc0med.github.io/myblog/posts/A%20Bit%20Learning%20Halal,%20Internationally%20(Pig%20Products)"
        target="_blank"
        >in this blog</a
      >).</p
    >
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some conditions will influence your
    halal living here in Indonesia... For example, the news spread about
    citizens' fear of vaccine/ medicine that made from pig parts.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"
      >Ok, i'm not from health field.
      Rather hearing about the cases, people more questioning of why using pigs
      (i'm more being a well-behaved listener in here).</p
    >
      <p style="text-align: justify;"
      >Okay... So i then didn't hear
      enough about that vaccine? Because of ... The fear. But, whatever,
      consider for what's available for the health urgency, that can be allowed.
      Once again, urgency. Kinda same case when you ever hear about you can eat
      pork like boar's meat when you have no food to eat to survive (in case
      you're lost). You'll dying, and that's not for eating it frequently,
      right?</p
    >
    <p style="text-align: justify;"
      >So, it just example for the pig
      issues right here. The balance of the fear vs the solution about the case must be reviewed carefully!</p
    >
  <h2 style="text-align: justify;">'Babi' Privilege
  </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"
      >As i know, around muslim
      community, or people who lived around Sumatra and Java island, 'babi' (pig
      in Indonesian) is something people will talk when it comes with serious
      issues, or being a slur/ cursing (you can hear 'Babi!' as a slur here).
      Muslim community itself already familiar that pork or pig things are
      clearly haram, and pig can be such cancel culture in muslim community.
      Clarifying i'm talking about Indonesian muslim. Of course it will be
      different situation from non-muslim community here (mostly in East
      Indonesia side)~</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      It's kinda boomerang when pigs
      become racism weapon for non muslim people, who has lack information about
      islam religion. Or, being consumed by islamophobia news (yeah, western or
      z1onism propaganda). Pig head in front of the mosque being alternatives
      than burning holy book Qur'an. Or they editing pig photo or illustration
      as a meme and share it in social media. Or gloryfing pig-based food.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      And, pig become terror tools!
      Yeah, you read it well. There's independent mass media being sent of pig's
      head and mice corpse, anonymously! Not just once! After we have a big
      demonstration/ march in last August #indonesiareset.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
    Babi Privilege~</h2>
     <p style="text-align: justify;">"Another heading but what's the
      point?"</p>
      <p style=" text-align: justify;">So here is this, babi is also
      being consumed by non-muslim here! Kinda funny when my friend sometimes
      craving pork, i mean okay for you, but it's weird for who the muslim who
      openly- erhm, what we talk about right now.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Example, in Bali (most famous of foreigner places) and more east side of Indonesia, eating pork is common things as muslim isn't the majority at there. Or if we wanna close to cultural things, pig can be part of sacrifice while ritual (in tribes or indigenous people), and i've heard that they can have pigs as mahr/ dowry! Doing it like cows or camels~</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Come again with pig things, that are rooted from eating habit in regions, also any parts of the world. The things is how much familiar people with and how we can understand each other routine, habit or even tradition. The keyword? Yep, tolerance! Regardless of the background, because we can't know all the details of people's habit, but we can respect other's choice.</p>
